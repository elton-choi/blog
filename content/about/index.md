I'm a Robotics Research Engineer in the South-Korea. I'm working on motion planning and control, model identification of robot arms. I want to push my boundaries further with mobile-manipulation, legged robotics and future-actuator platform on the hardware side, and machine learning on the software side.

I love explaining and sharing fundamental priciples from complicated engineering. I believe that if I can't explain something easily, it means I don't fully understand it. I think this applies not only to me.
